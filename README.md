# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This application was made so the user is able to check the weather of his/her future travel destination. With this application the user will be able to check the current weather of the desired city, as well as the weather forecast for he next 5 days. Building this project helped me get more comfortable when it comes to managing and understanding the data that comes when using an API. It also helped me practice how to navigate that data to get to a specific point of interest. I found managing data very fun!. This project also helped me practice populating a page using JavaScript instead of writing it in the HTML, this allows me to dynamically write a page using data that can differ every time the page is used.

## Usage

To Use the application please [Click Here!](https://renfunny.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/). The UI for the application is very simple and easy to navigate. First write the name of a city in the input field and click the search button. This will display the weather for that city (NOTE: if a misspelled city is entered nothing will happen). Once done a button with the name of the city will appear, this will persist in the page and can be clicked to get the weather for that city instead of typing it again.
Here is a screenshot of the application with some sample cities stored:
